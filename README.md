## üöÄ About Me
I'm a passionate software engineer with a deep love for modern web technologies, eCommerce platforms, and system-level programming. With experience in **JavaScript**, **Next.js**, **Shopify Plus**, and ongoing studies in **C++**, I am committed to building efficient solutions.

I enjoy solving complex problems and am always looking to expand my skill set, so I look forward to sharing my experience programming with C++. Across my journey with web development, eCommerce, and system programming, I've grown to appreciate the art of creating optimal systems that allow separate internal components to thrive together.
